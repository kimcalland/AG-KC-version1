# AG Challenge Kim Calland
Version 1
October 2018

This image style is based on an 80s retro video game style. Very popular in the meme world at the moment. Hoping to appeal to the demographic depicted in the brief.

There are 2 pages - index and subpage. The hero and banner images are designed to be responsive. The mock up webpage content is just to give the designs a place to sit, it is also responsive and based on the AG website.

I've used dreamweaver to build the site, which includes the main style.css and a sub-style.sass file.

Enjoy :-) 
Kim
